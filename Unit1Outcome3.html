        <h3> Question 3.1</h3>
        <p>Use of IT tools within project has its benefits, but also drawbacks. The benefits are that while using the tools is collaboration as well as finding help is easier and faster than using the traditional ways. Also, it will keep the users at the peak of their efficiency because they will stay on the right task and not do a task that has been done before. The website project could have been done in teams, for that we would have the required resources e.g. Trello to help with the assignment. Because there would be more people than now, more things could have been done on the website.</p>

        <h3>3.2</h3>
        <p>To improve productivity there are a variety of ways to do so. One of them is to maintain focus on one task, you can do that by removing any distractions like other tasks or any entertainment solutions e.g. YouTube, TV, etc. To improve Efficiency there are a lot of ways too. To stay on the peak of efficiency you need to stay on the task that hasn’t completed yet, so the use of tools like Trello help you a lot to stay on an uncompleted task. Also, to stay efficient you can move to another task if you are stuck at another one and come back with a “fresh” mind back to it.</p>

        <h3>3.3</h3>
        <p>To improve my own productivity, I would use Trello more and maybe Slack to send myself some notes on what I wanted to do the previous day, so I won’t forget my idea I had a day before. Working in a team will definitely improved the finished product, because all of the required and extra features would be distributed between more people so work load isn’t just on 1 person.</p>

        <h3>3.4</h3>
        <p>To test digital solutions, you can test yourself each outcome that can be achieved on the solution. Or you can ask someone else to test it for you. Then test on different devices, screen sizes and orientation of the device. Then if you store any kind of data, get a penetration tester to test your security and the security of the stored data.</p>
