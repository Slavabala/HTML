            <h3>Question 1.1</h3>
            <p>IT in modern businesses plays a massive role in most parts of the business e.g. in production IT is used for quality control, in finance there are algorithms that predict the estimated revenue the business is going to make in a quarter. IT simplifies many skill intensive jobs or outright replaces them.</p>

            <h3>1.2</h3>
            <p>To succeed in a digital project, there is a variety of skills required. Many of those skills obviously are related to computers like understanding of code or knowledge of computers. Method wise there are a few methods that apply to any problem even if it isn’t IT related. Abstraction is the process of removing unnecessary detail from a problem so that the important details can be focused on. This can make solving the problem easier. Decomposition is breaking down a BIG problem into smaller more manageable problems which can be easily solved on their own. Resource wise you need 2 things, a computer and an internet connection. These 2 things can solve pretty much any problem</p>

            <h3>1.3</h3>
            <p>Firstly, to create my website I would use Trello to see where I am up to and how much more and what kind of tasks I need to do and what tasks I have done. But before all of that I would sketch the websites design on paper and write down any feature I would want to add to the website. Then I would create a word document with the text I want to display on different web pages. <a href = "https://trello.com/b/UADDI2XK/website">Link to the Trello Board</a></p>

            <h3>1.4</h3>
            <p>There are a lot of risks in the digital world. The biggest are hackers. There are different types of them but only 1 type that causes harm. They will hack either for financial gain or for cause of chaos. Other risk is that because the applications that help you make the projects are online so if there is an outage, you won’t have access to the project. Another risk is that if someone gets unauthorised access to your online files of the project, that person can spy on your project or even outright plagiarise the whole thing.</p>

            <h3>1.5</h3>
            <p>Firstly, the tools that are going to be used for developing the project highly depend on a lot of things. One is the budged of the project for the tools, because I don’t have a budget, I will go for free online tools that I can find. Another is that how many people are going to be within the project. For me because I’m the only one, it doesn’t matter because any online tool can handle 1 person. For the choosing of IT systems there are only 2 choices: Mac or Windows. The choice between them is highly personal, which system do you prefer more. But if you need to do IOS development you have no choice but to work on Mac, install a virtual environment running MacOS on a windows machine or “rent” a Mac online. The better choosing of the right and relevant tool and system the higher is the chance of success of the project as well as minimising risk of failure.</p>

            <h3>1.6</h3>
            <p>For the last project my team used Trello and Slack for communication and coordination within the project. Trello was used to assign to each member what task to do, set priorities to set tasks and plan the whole project. Slack was used to share links while we were researching competing apps, share files and just general communication. These online tools helped my team members and myself to stay on relevant tasks, stay efficient because no tasks were done by 2 members when only 1 member was needed on the task and add more new ideas to perfect the application. GitHub can help with the version control due to any member that modified the code will “push” the change and the other members will get the updated code, so no member will be left without the up-to-date version.</p>
