        <h3>Question 1.5</h3>
        <p>Every website must declare the used copyright content with references to not get called out for stealing intellectual property. Also, if the website contains some collection of data, it has to declare where it goes or ask for permission to use it. Then the website must be secure if it handles any kind of payment or personal data e.g. Passports, ID’s etc.</p>

        <h3>1.6</h3>
        <p>People with some kind of disability that would want to access my website, would need some accessibility help. People with hard of seeing, would need to either turn on the text to speech engine within their OS, or increase the font size on the website. People with both hard of hearing and seeing, they can use this new invention which vibrates to the text that is “read out” by the TTS.</p>

        <h3>1.7</h3>
        <p>For a website PNG filetype is a perfect choice because PNG is a lossless type of compression of images, which means the image will be the same quality as it was taken. Then to create the website, HTML, CSS and JavaScript were used. These 3 languages are called the Triad of cornerstone technologies for the web. HTML is used for the structure of the website, CSS is the design of the website, and JS is used for the fancy things in the website e.g. animations, drop downs, smooth auto scroll etc.</p>
