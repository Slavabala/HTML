        <h3>Question 2.1</h3>
        <p>Visual Studio Code is a great environment to program pretty much anything. VSC has an inbuilt debugger, auto-completing words, and file manager. Also, it gives an ability to install extensions that help even more. One of the extensions I installed, automatically uploads the most recent version of my files to GitHub. I used Trello to store my ideas, assign the tasks that are required to do and the able to see which tasks I have already completed.</p>

        <h3>2.2</h3>
    <p>Trello wasn’t really that necessary as I was a team of 1, I could have used a simple paper checklist. Because of that I didn't find Trello as useful for me as it could of been useful for a team. VSC was appropriate for my project, there was nothing inside it that couldn’t be more appropriate for my project although any other IDE would also do. VSC was appropriate because I used it before and I was familiar with the user interface as well as the extensions that can be installed to help the user even more. So I installed an automated Git pusher, which pushed the most recent version to github without me using the console or anything else.</p>

        <p>Strengths of my project</p>
        <ol>
            <li>JavaScript to top button</li>
            <li>Active wallpaper change if orientation of device changes</li>
            <li>Font is similar to the overall wallpapers of the website</li>
            <li>Boxes around text to highlight the text</li>
            <li>The background moves</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Weaknesses</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Not enough information on Contact Me page</li>
            <li>Next time I would use grids to put things around the website</li>
            <li>Not enough information on the Main page about me</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>2.4</h3>
        <p><b><span>Furthermore, I wanted to add an active background that has a distortion effect just like on TV’s from the 80s</span></b>. Then I would add a form submission to contact me rather than giving out my contacts and add more information about my self on the main page. And background music matching the style of the website. To add a form submission I would need to create a new Email where all of the submissions will be sent as well as filter the submissions to not to get a malicious script transmitted to me trough the form.</p>

    <h3>2.5</h3>
    <p><b><span>I have only Unit 1 Outcome 3 and Unit 2 Outcome 1 Q 1.1 to do when I was answering this question.</span></b> I made my website to be as much error free as possible, if the active background won't load, there will be a matching static one. Before adding any text to my website, I added what I wanted into a word file, spell checked it and only after that added it into the webpages. To save time and minimize the chance of error, I created firstly a webpage template and used it each time I wanted to create a new webpage.</p>
